## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme configuration
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL database with configurable connection
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints with JSON responses
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle migrations in `/migrations` directory
- **Backup Storage**: In-memory storage implementation for development/testing
- **Session Storage**: Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Security**: Basic session-based authentication (expandable architecture)
- **CORS**: Configured for cross-origin requests

### External Service Integrations
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Puppeteer-based WhatsApp Web automation with dual-mode support
  - Simulation mode: For development and testing (default in Replit)
  - Real mode: For production with actual WhatsApp Web connection (requires local environment)
- **Scheduling**: Node-cron for automated birthday notifications
- **Email Support**: Prepared for email notifications (infrastructure ready)

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Monorepo Structure**: Single repository with clear separation between client, server, and shared code
- **Problem**: Need for code sharing between frontend and backend
- **Solution**: Shared schema definitions and TypeScript configurations
- **Benefits**: Type safety across full stack, easier maintenance

**Database Layer Abstraction**: Interface-based storage with multiple implementations
- **Problem**: Need for flexible data storage during development
- **Solution**: IStorage interface with both memory and database implementations
- **Benefits**: Easy testing, development flexibility, production scalability

**Component-Based UI**: Shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Problem**: Need for consistent, accessible UI components
- **Solution**: Pre-built component library with customization support
- **Benefits**: Rapid development, accessibility compliance, consistent design

**Service-Oriented Backend**: Separate services for WhatsApp and scheduling
- **Problem**: Complex business logic for messaging and automation
- **Solution**: Dedicated service classes with clear responsibilities
- **Benefits**: Maintainable code, testable components, scalable architecture

**Type-Safe Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM with Zod validation
- **Problem**: Runtime errors from database operations and data validation
- **Solution**: Compile-time type checking with runtime validation
- **Benefits**: Reduced bugs, better developer experience, data integrity

## Recent Changes

### 2025-08-11: WhatsApp Integration Setup
- **WhatsApp Real Mode Implementation**: Added support for real WhatsApp Web connection using Puppeteer
- **Dual Mode System**: Implemented switching between simulation and real modes
- **Environment Limitations**: Documented Replit environment constraints for Puppeteer
- **Message Templates**: Created comprehensive birthday and reminder templates with variables:
  - Variables: [NOME], [CARGO], [IDADE], [DATA_NASCIMENTO]
  - Reminder template for day-before notifications
  - Birthday template for same-day celebrations
- **Test Data**: Populated database with 10 sample employees for testing
- **UI Enhancement**: Added WhatsApp connection interface with QR code display capability

### Production Notes
- WhatsApp real mode requires local environment or Docker with proper system dependencies
- In Replit: Use simulation mode for development and testing
- For production: Deploy to environment with libgbm1, libnss3, libxss1, libgtk-3-0, libasound2
